        <p>
          While I am very new to the web development world, I quickly have come
          to appreciate and enjoy many different aspects. I first wanted to be
          an engineer because I loved problem solving. More than anything, I
          love the feeling of satisfaction when the problem is finally solved
          and you can move on to the next one. It turns out that web development
          has endless problems that need solving. Whether it be learning a new
          language or framework, building a new application or refactoring and
          debugging an existing one, the potential for growth is unlimited and
          riveting.
